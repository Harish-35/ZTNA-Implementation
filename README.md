# 🛡️ ZTNA-Implementation
Designed and implemented a Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) architecture using Twingate, securing a private Nginx web application on Ubuntu with HTTPS encryption and controlled access via identity-based authentication, eliminating the need for traditional VPN.

---

##  Architecture
- **Client Device** – Access via Twingate client application
- **Twingate Cloud** – Identity-based access control
- **Ubuntu Server** – Hosts the private web application
- **Twingate Connector** – Secure outbound tunnel from private network
- **Nginx** – Web server configured with HTTPS
